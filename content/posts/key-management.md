## Background

This morning, promptly at 7AM I received a call from one of our operations personnel indicating that no one's badge work on the HID readers at one of our buildings. My thoughts immediately drifted to an email indicating a database migration for the security system. After 15 minutes of calls and attempts at remote access, it was determined that there was a layer 3 issue at the iStar panel and it would have to be fixed locally. Fast forward almost 2 hours later, and we're finally in the building after the locksmith came and unlocked the building with a master key. 

## What Happened

No one had a key, a confirmed key was over 40 minutes away at another location and records indicated that 2 keys had been distributed but no one had those keys. Upon further investigation those keys were in fact inside a drawer inside the locked building. No party was aware of those keys locations prior to discovery.

## Why it Matters

Key management is a vital to a business. It represents the junction of several components of a secure, successful business. Having too many keys, not clearly identifying key holders, not knowing where keys are; these are all undesirable and potentially revenue impacting situations. 

On their own keys represent access without audit ability. Why the normal means of access is proximity readers that can be tracked and disabled as needed, keys represent a deviation from expected norm as it removes the authorization inherent in an issued badge. This is can be a compliance issue if keys allow access to records subject regulation.

Keys are also a backup to failures of electronic locks. They provide a means to control access when the lock system is not available. Business can go on because of keys. Failure to track copies of a given key creates a business continuity issue if the organization cannot perform normal functions because of the lack of a certain key. 

Keys are very much a bastion of security. We use keys for our vehicles, lockboxes, doors, panels, server cages, etc. If something has a door, it can likely be locked with a key. Physical security is only such if the location of the keys is known and custody can be attested with documentation. 

## Lessons Learned 

I guess the big lesson learned here is two fold. First ensure that the proceedure for failure of electronic systems is well documented and known to relevant parties. Second if keys are handed to a middle man for distribution, follow to ensure that their is accountability and the keys in question are actually where they are assigned.
