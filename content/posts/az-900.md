# Passing AZ-900

On Friday, I sat for the AZ-900 exam via Pearson Vue Online and passed earning my Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals certification. In studying for this exam I used a mixture of several resources including video courses, the official Microsoft docs, and hand-ons.

I purchased the MeasureUp practice exams alogn with the exams. For me this was a great resource for learning the format of a Microsoft exam with my only prior experience having been with Comptia's exam format. I also tried some random exam type questions avilable online or thorugh random Android apps. I don't know how useful these were but they fill in nicely when you have a spare 5 minutes.

Video resources included Tim Warner's fantastic Youtube series [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfZ1kgHlrfg&list=PLYGZ9Q0oTOHfsI-3IAhvyc09ssPDfoePv) along with freeCodeCamp's 3 hour course [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKEFWyqJ5XA). I also watched Tim Warner's Microsoft Ignite talk about passing the AZ-900 exam [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfid92Q1z10) and John Savill's overview of the objective domain [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1nB1RYihJg)

I definitely feel that this was a fantastic overview of the bulk of Azure's core services as well as how to budget and manage your Azure environment. I am now moving on the study for the AZ-104 exam with the goal of sitting for the exam by the end of the year.
